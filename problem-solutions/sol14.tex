\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem}
  What is the \textbf{Schwarz-Christoffel integral}?

    Be careful to discuss the choice of branches in the terms appearing
      in the integrand.
      \end{problem}
      \begin{solution}
      Let $\{a_1, \dots, a_N\}$ be a sequence of increasing real numbers and $\{b_1, \dots b_N\}$ a sequence of real numbers with $0<b_n<1$ for all $1\leq n\leq N$ such that $1 < \sum_{n=1}^N b_n$.
      \[
      S(z) = \int_0^z \left( \prod_{n=1}^N (\zeta - a_n)^{-b_n} \right) d\zeta
      \]
      The term $\zeta - a_n$ is defined using the log with a branch cut on the line $a_n - bi$ for $b\geq 0$. The cut is choosen so that $(\zeta - a_n)^{-b_n} = |\zeta - a_n|^{-b_n}$.
      \end{solution}
      \begin{problem}
        What is an elliptic integral?
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
        An elliptic integral is a function $f:\R\to \R$ of the form
        \[
        f(y) = \int_0^y R(x, \sqrt{P(x)} dx
        \]
        with $R$ rational function and $P$ a polynomial of degree 3 or four.

        \end{solution}
        \begin{problem}
          What is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind?

            This integral is usually denoted by $F$, but confusingly the input
              to $F$ is sometimes called the ``parameter'' and other times called
                the ``modular angle'' and \textit{these are different}!
                \end{problem}
                \begin{solution}
                The incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind is a function 
                \[
                F(\varphi, k) = \int_0^\varphi \frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1- k^2\sin^2\theta}}
                \]

                \end{solution}
                \section{Computation}

                \begin{problem}
                  Find all solutions to
                    \[
                        \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} = 1
                          \]
                            for integers $x,y,z \in \Z$.
                            \end{problem}
                            \begin{solution}
                            WLOG let $x\leq y\leq z$. Then we must have $x\leq 3$ so the LHS is at least as big as 1. If $x=1,$ there is clearly no solution, and if $x=3$, then the only possible solution is $x=y=z.$

                            Finally we consider the case $x=2.$ In this case, we need to solve
                            \begin{align*}
                            \frac{1}{y} + \frac{1}{z} &= \frac{1}{2}\\
                            yz - 2z - 2y &= 0\\
                            (y - 2)(z - 2) &= 4\\
                            \end{align*}
                            From $1*4 = 4$ we get $y=3, z=6$ as a solution. From $2*2=4$ we get $y=z=4.$ There are no more factorizations of $4$ where the second term is bigger than the first, so these three are the only solutions up to permuting the variables.
                            \end{solution}
                            \begin{problem}
                              For $w$ in the upper half-plane, consider
                                \[
                                    f(w) = \int_0^w  \frac{dz}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}
                                      \]
                                        where $\sqrt{1-z^2}$ is holomorphic in the upper half-plane and positive when $w \in (-1,1)$.

                                          The function $f$ provides a conformal map from the upper half-plane to what region?

                                            What is a well-known name for the function $f$?
                                            \end{problem}
                                            \begin{solution}

                                            Let's rewrite this function 
                                              \[
                                                  f(w) = \int_0^w  (1-z)^\frac{-1}{2}(1+z)^\frac{-1}{2} dz
                                                    \]
                                                    When $z\in (-1, 1),$ the integrand is strictly positive, so $f(w)$ and the image of is the real line on the interval with $x<R$ with $R$ given by
                                                    \[
                                                    \int_0^1 \frac{dz}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} = \arcsin(z)\bigg|_{z=0}^1 = \frac{\pi}{2}
                                                    \]
                                                    When $z\in (1, \infty)$, the integrand $(1-z)$ is purely imaginary, so the image is a vertical line starting at $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and going up. Since
                                                    \[
                                                    \lim_{w\to\infty} \int_0^w (1-z)^\frac{-1}{2}(1+z)^\frac{-1}{2} dz = \lim_{w\to\infty} \int_0^w O(\frac{1}{z}) = \infty
                                                    \]
                                                    the line goes all the way to $\oo.$ Similarly, the image of $(-\oo, -1)$ is a vertical line from $\frac{-\pi}{2}$ going straight up to $\oo.$

                                                    To decide which side of this box is the image of the interior of the half plane, notice that this is the integral of the derivative of the arcsin function, so this function is nothing but $\arcsin(z)$. $\arcsin$ will sends values into an injective domain of $\sin$, so it must send the upper half plane to the interior of this box rather than the exterior.
                                                    \end{solution}
                                                    \begin{problem}
                                                      Consider the function
                                                        \[
                                                            f(w) = \int_0^w  \frac{dz}{\sqrt{z} \sqrt{z+1} \sqrt{z-1}}
                                                              \]
                                                                which maps the upper half-plane to a square (after making appropriate branch cuts!).

                                                                  What is the side length of the square?

                                                                    \end{problem}

                                                                    Considering the derivative of this function, we see that it takes 3 right turns at the points $-1, 0, 1,$ and $\infty$ Using the branch cuts from the definition of the Schwarz-Christoffel integral, the integrand is real and positive when $z\in (1, \infty)$. So we can compute the side length of the square by integrating over this derivative from 1 to infinity. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, it is 
                                                                    \[

                                                                    \]
                                                                    Wolfram Alpha tells us that this is

The Cayley transform maps the unit disk to the upper half plane biholomorphically, and the integral will map the half plane into the interior of a polygon biholomorphically.

                                                                        \begin{problem}  
                                                                          When can a holomorphic map $f : B_1(0) \to B_1(0)$ have more than two fixed points?
                                                                          \end{problem}
                                                                          \begin{solution}
                                                                          The only time that $f$ can have two or more fixed points is when it is constant. Suppose, we have two points $a,b$ so that $f(a)=a$ and $f(b)=b.$

                                                                          We can find a biholomorphic map from the unit disk to itself swapping the point $a$ with the point $0$, call it $g$. Then it follows that 
                                                                          \[
                                                                          (g^{-1}\circ f \circ g)(0) = (g^{-1}\circ f)(a) = g^{-1}(a) = 0
                                                                          \]
                                                                          Now we can apply the Schwarz lemma to the function $g^{-1}\circ f \circ g$ to conclude that if this function has a fixed point besides 0, then it must be constant.

                                                                          Since $g$ is bijective, there is a point $c$ so that $g(c)=b$ (hence $g^{-1}(b)= c$). Then
                                                                          \[
                                                                          (g^{-1}\circ f \circ g)(c) = (g^{-1}\circ f)(b) = g^{-1}(b) = c
                                                                          \]

                                                                          \end{solution}

Consider for example a cubic polynomial $p(z).$ At a fixed point, $p(z)=z$, and by the fundamental theorem of algebra, $p(z)-z$ has three roots. We can choose $p(z)$ so that there are no repeated roots and then find an example of such a function.
                                                                              \end{solution}

At the point $A$, the curve takes a counterclockwise turn of exterior angle $\alpha - \pi$, hence interior angle $\alpha$. Similarly at the point $B$, the curve takes a counterclockwise turn of angle $\beta.$

Thus the image of the real line line is the triangle with verticies $f(A), f(B),$ and $\lim_{z\to\infty} f(z).$

                                                                                                                          Considering polygonal regions of the plane, this is false, since we can scale, shift, and rotate a polygon to change it. However, up to scaling and shifting, it is True. Given two polygons $P_1=[c_{1,1}, c_{1,2},\dots c_{1,n}]$ and $P_2 = [c_{2,1}, c_{2,2},\dots c_{2,n}]$ so that $c_{1,i}$ is the corner of $P_1$ with the same interior angle as $c_{2,i}$, we scale, shift, and rotate so that $c_{1,1}=c_{2,1}$ and $c_{1,2}=c_{2,2}$.

                                                                                                                          Now assume that for $1, 2, \dots k$, $c_{1,k}=c_{2,k}$ with $k\geq 2.$ Then consider the triangle with corners 
                                                                                                                          \[
                                                                                                                          \triangle(c_{1,k-1}, c_{1,k}, c_{1, k+1}) =
                                                                                                                          \triangle(c_{2,k-1}, c_{2,k}, c_{1, k+1})
                                                                                                                          \]
                                                                                                                          Now, since this triangle has two of the same verticies as $\triangle(c_{2,k-1}, c_{2,k}, c_{2, k+1})$, and the angles associated with the two verticies are the same, these two triangles are the same by ASA triangle similarity. Thus $c_{2, k+1} = c_{1, k+1}.$

                                                                                                                          By induction, all of the corners of $P_1$ and $P_2$ are in the same place and so the two polygons are equal.

Then on the unit circle, $\abs{g(z)}>\abs{f(z)}$. Since $g(z)$ has one zero contained in the unit circle, Rouche's theorem, tells us that $g(z) + f(z)$ has exactly one zero in the unit cirlce. Let $z_{n}$ be the point where

Since $f(z) - z$ is continuous and every open ball around $A$ contains points arbitrarily close to $0$, it follows that $f(A) - A = 0.$ Thus $A$ is a fixed point of $f$.
