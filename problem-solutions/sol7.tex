    With this being a ``short'' week because of the instructional break,
    this problem set is concomitantly shorter.

    \section{Terminology}

    \begin{problem}
      What is a harmonic function?
      \end{problem}
      \begin{solution}
      Let $U$ be an open subset of $\C$. A function $f:U \to \R$ is real harmonic if $f\in C^2$ and $\Delta f = 0$.
      \end{solution}
      \begin{problem}
        Define the term \textbf{harmonic conjugate}.  (Recall \ref{harmonic-conjugate}.)
        \end{problem}
        \begin{solution}
        A harmonic conjugate of a harmonic funcion $f$ is a function $g$ such that $f+ig$ is holomorphic.
        \end{solution}

        \section{Numericals}

        \begin{problem}\label{relate-fourier-and-taylor-series}Let $S^1 := \{(x,y) \in \R^2 : x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}$ and $D_1(0) := \{ (x,y) \in \R^2 : x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \}$.  Find a continuous function $F : D_1(0) \to \R$ that is harmonic on the interior of $D_1(0)$ and that extends
          $f : S^1 \to \R$ given by
           \[
              f(\cos \theta,\sin \theta) = \sum_{k=0}^N \left(c_k \, \cos \left( k\theta \right) + s_k \, \sin \left( k \theta \right) \right).
               \]
                (This problem encourages you to relate Fourier series and Taylor series.)
                \end{problem}
                \begin{solution}
                Extend $f$ to the disk by the following equation:
                \[
                F(r, \theta) = f(\theta)r^{k}
                \]
                On the open disk, $r=1$ and so the additional term we multiply by is $r^1=1$, and thus this function agrees with $f$ on the edges of the disk. As a sum and product of infinitely differentiable functions, it is $C^2$.

                Checking that the laplacian $F_{xx} + F_{yy} = 0$ is equivalent to checking the following in polar coordinates:
                \begin{align*}
                F_{rr} +  \frac{F_r}{r} + \frac{F_{\theta\theta}}{r^2} &= 0\\
                f(\theta)k(k-1)r^{k-2} +  \frac{f(\theta)kr^{k-1}}{r} + \frac{(-f(\theta))r^k}{r^2} &= 0\\
                r^{k-2}(k(k-1) +  k - k^2) &= 0\\
                r^{k-2}\cdot 0 &= 0
                \end{align*}
                Thus this function is harmonic on the interior of $D$.
                \end{solution}
                \section{Exploration}

                \begin{problem}
                  Recall \ref{where-converge-one-over-n}.  Consider the power series for the \textbf{dilogarithm} function,
                    \[
                        \dilog(z) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{z^n}{n^2}.
                          \]
                            What is its radius $r$ of convergence?  Where on the boundary of
                              $B_r(0)$ does this series converge?  (Note that there is no pole on
                                the boundary; not every singularity is a pole!)
                                \end{problem}
                                \begin{solution}
                                The radius of convergence is 1: if $r > 1$, then  
                                \[\abs{Li_2(r)} = \sum_1^\infty \frac{r^n}{n^2}\]
                                But as $n\to\infty$, 
                                \[
                                \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{r^n}{n^2} = \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{nr^{n-1}}{2n} =  \lim_{n\to \infty} n(n-1)r^{n-2} = \infty,
                                \]
                                so the terms grow arbitrarily large, and thus the sum diverges.

                                On the other hand, if $r\leq 1$, then 
                                \[\abs{Li_2(z)} \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6},\]
                                so the sum converges absolutely and thus the sum converges everywhere on the closed unit ball of radius 1, and nowhere outside of it.
                                %TODO This seems too easy?
                                \end{solution}
                                \begin{problem}\label{laplacian-via-wirtinger}Consider an open set
                                  $U \subset \C$ and a holomorphic function $f : U \to \C$.  Write
                                    the \textbf{Laplacian}
                                      \[
                                          \Delta := \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2}

                                                \pfrac{}{z}\pfrac{}{\conj{z}} &= \frac{1}{2}(\pfrac{}{x} - i\pfrac{}{y})\frac{1}{2}(\pfrac{}{x} + i\pfrac{}{y})\\
                                                &= \frac{1}{4}(\ppfrac{}{x} + \ppfrac{}{y}) = \frac{\Delta}{4}
                                                \end{align*}

                                                    a harmonic function $g : V \to \R$.  Is the composition $g \circ f$
                                                      a harmonic function on $V$?
                                                      \end{problem}

                                                      &=  g_{xx}(u, v)(u_x + v_x)^2 + g_x(u, v)(u_{xx} + v_{xx})\\
                                                      &=  g_{xx}(u, v)(u_x - u_y)^2 \color{purple} \qquad \text{Cauchy Riemann Equations}

                                                      Let's do the same for the y derivative

                                                      \ppfrac{g(u, v)}{y} &= \pfrac{}{y}\left( g_y(u, v)(u_y + v_y) \right)\\

                                                      Then $g\circ f$ is harmonic since,
                                                      \begin{align*}

                                                                                        &= \Re\left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{g(z + re^{i\theta})ire^{i\theta}}{re^{i\theta}}d\theta\right)\\

                                                                                        \end{align*}
                                                                                        Subtracting $f(z)$, we see that 
                                                                                        \begin{align*}
                                                                                        0 = \frac{1}{2\pi }\int_0^{2\pi} f(w) - f(z) d\theta

Since this is true for all circles centered at $z$, the set of points which achieve the maximum value of $f$ is open, and the complement of this set is the preimage of the open set $\R/\{f(z)\}$, so it is open. Since $U$ is connected, $f$ is constna

                                                                                                  $f : B_{r + \delta}(a) \to \C$, there exists $N$ so that

                                                                                                        \sup_{z \in D_r(a)} \abs{ f(z) - \sum_{n=0}^N a_n z^n } < \epsilon.

                                                                                                            \end{problem}

                                                                                                            This is super false, since the power series isn't neccessarily the power series of $f$. For example, take $a_n=1$ and $f=0$, and consider the disk of radius .2 around the point $0$. Then $\sum_{n=0}^N a_nz^n = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^N 0^n = 1$ for any $N$ but $f(0) = 0$.

                                                                                                            Let's choose $f$ first, and let the power series be the taylor series of $f$ at the point $0$. We can write it out using Cauchy's integral formula and a positively oriented curve $\gamma$ around the circle of radius $r+\delta$.

                                                                                                            \begin{align}\label{Taylor_Series_0_for_f}
                                                                                                                f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^N \int_\gamma \frac{f(w) dw}{w^{n+1}}z^n
                                                                                                                \end{align}

                                                                                                                Now we just really need to show that this function approaches $f(z)$. We can apply Cauchy's integral formula to $f$ in a small circle $\gamma_2$ centered at $z$ and contained in the circle $\gamma$ .
                                                                                                                \begin{align}\label{Cauchys_Integral_Formula_for_f}
                                                                                                                    f(z) &= \int_{\gamma_2} \frac{f(w) dw}{w - z}
                                                                                                                    \end{align}
                                                                                                                    In fact, we can replace $\gamma_2$ with $\gamma$ since the two curves are homotopic on the set $\C\setminus z$ where the function $\frac{f(w)}{w-z}$ is holomorphic. Thus we need to show that difference of the RHS of equations \ref{Taylor_Series_0_for_f} and \ref{Cauchys_Integral_Formula_for_f} is 0.
