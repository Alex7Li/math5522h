\section{Terminology}

\begin{problem}
  What is a \textbf{Jordan curve}?
  \end{problem}
  \begin{solution}
  A Jordan curve is a simple closed piecewise smooth function $\gamma:[a,b]\mapsto \C$.
  \end{solution}
  \begin{problem}
    Define the \textbf{winding number} $n(\gamma,z)$ of a piecewise
      smooth closed curve $\gamma$ around a point $z \in \C$.
      \end{problem}
      \begin{solution}
      It's the net number of times you spin around clockwise, or
      \[n(\gamma, z) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_\gamma \frac{1}{x-z}dx \]

      \end{solution}
      \section{Numericals}

      \begin{problem}\label{Fresnel integral}
      Compute the \textbf{Fresnel integrals}
        \[
            \int_0^\infty \sin \left( x^2 \right) \, dx \mbox{ and } \int_0^\infty \cos \left( x^2 \right) \, dx.
              \]
              \end{problem}
              We can do them both at once, let $f(x) = \cos(x^2) + i\sin(x^2)$. Then the real part of $\int_0^\infty f(x)dx$ is the value of the cosine integral, and the imaginary part is the value of the sin integral. Noting that $f(x) = e^{ix^2}$, we itegrate around the eighth circle of radius $R$, $\gamma$ in figure \ref{octant-tikz}.

                          \end{figure}
                          \begin{align*}
                          \int_\gamma e^{iz^2}
                          &= \int_0^R e^{iz^2}dz + \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} (ie^{i\theta}) e^{i(Re^{i\theta})^2} d\theta + \int_0^R e^{5\pi/4}e^{i(ze^{i\pi/4})^2)}dz \\
                          &= \int_0^R e^{iz^2}dz + \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{4}} ie^{iR^2\cos(2\theta) - R^2\sin(2\theta) + i\theta} d\theta - e^{\pi/4} \int_0^R e^{-z^2}dz
                          \end{align*}
                          Letting $R$ go to infinity, the middle term vanishes since the real part of the exponent $R^2\sin(2\theta) + \cos(\theta)$ goes to $-\infty$. The last term becomes the classic statistics integral with value $\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$. Since $\int_\gamma f(x)$ is the integral of a holomorphic function around a closed curve, by cauchy's theorem it's value is 0 so we can deduce that 
                          \[\int_0^\infty e^{iz^2}dz = e^{\pi/4} \int_0^R e^{-z^2}dz =  \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{8}} + \frac{i\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{8}}\]
                          so 
                            \[
                                \int_0^\infty \sin \left( x^2 \right) \, dx = \int_0^\infty \cos \left( x^2 \right) \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt{8}}
                                  \]
                                  \begin{problem}
                                    For an integrable function $f : \R \to \C$, define the
                                      \textbf{Fourier transform} of $f$, denoted $\hat{f}$, by
                                        \[
                                            {\hat {f}}(\xi ) := \int _{-\infty }^{\infty} f(x) \, e^{-2\pi ix \xi} \,dx.
                                              \]
                                                Find the Fourier transform of $f(x) = e^{-\pi x^2}$.
                                                \end{problem}
                                                \begin{solution}
                                                We solve this by completing the square in the exponent:
                                                \begin{align}\label{completed_square_fourier}
                                                -\pi x^2 - 2\pi ix\xi = -\pi(x-i\xi)^2 - \pi \xi^2
                                                \end{align}
                                                We want to do something like below,
                                                \begin{align*}
                                                {\hat {f}}(\xi ) &=  \int _{-\infty }^{\infty} e^{-\pi x^2 -2\pi ix \xi} \,dx\\
                                                &=  e^{-\xi^2\pi}\int _{-\infty }^{\infty} e^{-\pi (x-i\xi)^2} \,dx\quad \color{purple} \text{ By Eq. \ref{completed_square_fourier}}
                                                \end{align*}
                                                This integral can almost be evaluated with a $u$ subsitution of 
                                                \[u = x-i\xi.\]
                                                However, the bounds of integration will be messed up and we will be going over the complex numbers. So let's consider the closed rectangular contour that goes on a straight line between the four points below.
                                                \[R \mapsto R - i\zeta \mapsto - R - i\zeta \mapsto -R\]
                                                As $R\to\infty$, the sides of this rectangle with nonzero imaginary derivative will disappear as
                                                \[
                                                \abs{\int_{-\zeta}^{0} e^{-\pi((\pm R+ix) -i\zeta)^2} dx} \leq \abs{\zeta} \abs{e^{-\pi R}}\to 0.
                                                \]
                                                Thus the integral of the bottom of the rectangle is equal to the integral going backwards along the top of the rectangle, which we can compute
                                                \begin{align*}
                                                \hat f(\zeta) &=  e^{-\xi^2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-\pi x^2} \,dx\\
                                                &=  \frac{e^{-\xi^2\pi}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \,dx\quad \color{purple} u = \sqrt{\pi}x, du = \sqrt{\pi} dx\\
                                                &=  \frac{e^{-\xi^2\pi}}{\sqrt{\pi}} \sqrt{\pi} =  e^{-\xi^2\pi}
                                                \end{align*}

                                                \end{solution}

Now, draw a rectangle parallel to that side of height $\delta$ as wide as possible, and then draw a rectangle on that and so on until you can't anymore. (See Figure \ref{curve-triangle-rectangles}).

                                                                                                Now, because $f$ is continous on the compact set that is the interior of $\gamma_{\Delta}$ it is uniformly continuous, so we can choose $\delta$ such that the value of $f$ varies by less than $\epsilon$ at any two points on the same small cut up piece. As the pieces get smaller, the top strangely shaped piece will have a very small arc length and so the value of the integral around it goes to 0, so we can ignore it. Next we can bound the integral around any other triangle $\gamma_{i}$. If $f$ is a constant, then the integral around the triangle is 0, so
                                                                                                \[\abs{\int_{\gamma_i} f dz} = \abs{\int_{\gamma_i} f dz- \inf_{\gamma_i}(f)} \leq |\gamma_i|\epsilon\].

Thus we can bound the integral around $\gamma_\Delta$ by choosing $\delta$ so as to make $\epsilon$ tiny:
                                                                                                \[\abs{\int_{\gamma_\Delta} f}\leq 3\abs{\gamma_{\Delta}}\epsilon\to 0\]

                                                                                                                                                   Then $\displaystyle\int_\gamma f\, dz = 0$.

Even if it's closed, if $f$ is not holomorphic, then going around a rectangle may be a problem (for example consider the computation in \ref{conjz_no_primitive}). So we really want to suppose that $\gamma$ is closed and $f$ is holomorphic. We will prove the following.
                                                                                                                                                     \begin{theorem}\label{general-curve-theorem}
                                                                                                                                                     Let $\gamma$ be a piecewise smooth curve in an open set $S$, and $f:S\mapsto \C$ be holomorphic. If the interior of $\gamma$ is contained in $S$, then \[\int_{\gamma} fdz = 0\].
                                                                                                                                                     \end{theorem}
                                                                                                                                                     Theorem \ref{triangle-theorem} tells use this is true if $\gamma$ is the curve of a polygon. Since $\gamma$ is smooth, it is rectifiable, so we can draw a polygonal path $\gamma(t_0), \gamma(t_1), \dots, \gamma(t_{n-1}), \gamma(t_n)$ with $\gamma(t_n)=\gamma(t_0)$ that approximates $\gamma$. Since $S$ is open we can ensure this path in contained inside of it. By rectifiablity, we can choose the path such that for any $\delta > 0$,
                                                                                                                                                     \[\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\abs{\gamma(t_i) - \gamma(t_{i+1})} - \int_{t_i}^{t_{i+1}} f(\gamma(t)) dt \leq \delta \]
                                                                                                                                                     Let $\gamma_{i}'$ be the integral on the line directly from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$ and then back from $t_{i+1}$ to $t_{i}$ along the curve $\gamma$. We can choose $t_i$ to be close enough to each other that any two points on $\gamma_{i}'$ are at most $\delta$ away from each other, and since the polygon is compact and $f$ is continuous, for any $\epsilon > 0$ we can choose $\delta$ such that 
                                                                                                                                                     \[x - y < \delta \implies f(x) - f(y) < \epsilon\].

                                                                                                                                                     Now, since the line integral of interior of the polygon is 0 by Theorem \ref{triangle-theorem}, the value of the line integral around $\gamma$ is bounded by the sum of the integrals of the segments between the approximating polygon and the curve.

This is bounded, since $\abs{f(z)}\leq 1$. But it's clearly not constant. However, we can prove it if we take $U=\C$.

Then by \ref{derivative-dies-holomorphic},

Then $\frac{1}{p(z)}$ is holomorphic, and outside of the ball of radius $M$, it's value is at most $\frac{1}{M_2}$. And it's holomorphic hence continuous and thus also bounded inside the compact set that is the ball of radius $M$. Thus $\frac{1}{p(z)}$ is bounded, and by \ref{liouville-theorem}, it is constant.
