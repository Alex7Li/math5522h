  \textit{Logic sometimes makes monsters.} For half a century we have
    seen a mass of bizarre functions which appear to be forced to
      resemble as little as possible honest functions which serve some
        purpose. More of continuity, or less of continuity, more
          derivatives, and so forth.
            \byline{Henri Poincar\'e} % can someone find the actual reference for this?!

            \section{Terminology}

            \begin{problem}
              What is meant by uniform convergence on compact sets?
              \end{problem}
              \begin{solution}
              A sequence of functions $f_n:A \to B$ is said to uniformly converge on compact sets if the limiting function $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n = f$ exists and for any compact subset $S\subset A$, the sequence restricted to $S$ converges uniformly to $f$ restricted to $f$. 
              That is, for any $\delta>0$ we can find an $\epsilon>0$, $n$ so that 
              \[\forall s_1, s_2\in S,\, d(s_1, s_2) \leq \epsilon \implies d(f_n(s_1), f(s_2)) \leq \delta.\]
              \end{solution}
              \begin{problem}
                What is a biholomorphism $f : U \to V$?
                \end{problem}
                \begin{solution}
                $f$ is said to be a biholomorphism if there exists a holomorphic function $g$ such that $f\circ g = g\circ f = Id$. 
                \end{solution}
                \begin{problem}
                  Define \textbf{star-convex}.
                  \end{problem}
                  \begin{solution}
                  A set $U\in \C$ is said to be start-convex if $\exists z \in U$ such that for any point $w \in U$, for any $t\in [0, 1]$, $zt + w(1-t) \in U$.
                  \end{solution}

                  \section{Numericals}

                  \begin{problem}\label{max-modulus-numerical}
                    Consider $f(z) = 4z - (2z - i)^2 - 2i - 4$.  Find $z$ in 
                      \[
                          \{ x + iy \in \C : 0 \leq x \leq 1 \mbox{ and } 0 \leq y \leq 1 \}
                            \]
                              maximizing $\abs{f(z)}$.
                              \end{problem}
                              \begin{solution}
                              First we can try to expand $f$
                              \begin{align*}
                              f(x+ iy) = (-4 x^2 + 4 x + 4 y^2 - 4y - 3) + (-8 x y +  4 x + 4y - 2)i
                              \end{align*}

                              By the maximum modulus principal %\ref{maximum-modulus-principle}
                              , the maximum value of $\abs{f(z)}$ will occur on the boundary of the region. So we need to find the max over 4 lines:
                              \begin{align*}
                              f_1(x) &= (-4 x^2 + 4 x - 3) + (4 x - 2)i\quad \color{purple} y=0\\ 
                              f_2(y) &=  (4 y^2 - 4y - 3) + (4y - 2)i \quad \color{purple} x=0\\
                              f_3(x) &=  (-4 x^2 + 4 x - 3) + (-4 x + 2)i \quad \color{purple} y=1 \\
                              f_4(y) &=  (4 y^2 - 4y - 3) + (-4y + 2)i \quad \color{purple} x=1
                              \end{align*}
                              These are really similar, after squaring the $i$ term is equal and thus we want to choose signs so as to maximize
                              \begin{align*}
                              \abs{f(t)} &= (\pm 4(t^2 - t) -3)^2 + (4t - 2)^2
                              \end{align*}
                              Since $4(t^2 - t)$ is always negative and less than 3 in magnitude for $0\leq t \leq 1$, the maximum will come on when we choose the plus sign.
                              \begin{align*}
                              \abs{f(t)} &= (4(t^2 - t) -3)^2 + (4t - 2)^2\\
                              &= 16(t^2 - t)^2 - 24(t^2 - t)  + 9+ 16(t^2 - t) + 4\\
                              &= 16(t^2 - t)^2 - 8(t^2 - t) + 13
                              \end{align*}
                              When $t\in [0, 1]$, $t^2 - t\in [-\frac{1}{4}, 0]$, and letting $u = f(t^2-t)$, the maximum comes when $u$ is at the endpoints or a local extrema. The values at the endpoints are $13$ and $16$. There are no local extrma of $u$ on the interval- at such a point, the derivative would be in the interval
                              \begin{align*}
                              \pfrac{f}{u} &= \pfrac{}{u}16u^2 - 8u + 13\\
                              0 &= 8u + 16\\
                              u &= 2
                              \end{align*}
                              Thus the maximum value is $16$, and it occurs when $t^2-t=\frac{-1}{4}$, so when $t = .5$, which corresponds to either the point $.5i$ or $1+.5i$
                              \end{solution}
                              \section{Exploration}

                              \begin{problem}\label{uniform_limit_is_holomorphic}
                                Sometimes things are \textit{much} better in the complex case than
                                  the real case.  Find a sequence of smooth functions
                                    $f_n : [-1,1] \to \R$ converging uniformly to $f(x) = \abs{x}$ which
                                      is not differentiable at zero.  Can the uniform limit of holomorphic
                                        functions fail to be holomorphic?
                                        \end{problem}
                                        \begin{solution}
                                        We can use fourier series to find such a sum of functions. Since the function is odd, the nth coefficient is 
                                        \[\int_{-1}^1 f(x)\cos(n\pi x)x dx = 2((-1)^n-1)\cos(\pi nx).\] Since $f(x)$ is continuous and $f'(x)$ exists at all by finitely many points and is square integrable, the Dirichlet conditions for Fourier series imply that the following sequence converges uniformly to $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$:
                                        \begin{align*}
                                            f_n = \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^n \frac{2((-1)^n-1)\cos(\pi nx)}{(n\pi)^2}
                                            \end{align*}

                                            For holomorphic functions, any sequence will again converge to a holomorphic function. Let $g_n$ be a sequence of holomorphic functions with limiting function $g$. Then for each $g_n$, the integral around any curve $\gamma$ is 0. Taking the limit, 
                                            \begin{align*}
                                                \int_\gamma g &= \int_\gamma \lim_{n\to\infty} g_n dz\\
                                                    &= \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_\gamma  g_n dz \quad \color{purple} \text{Uniform Convergence}\\
                                                        &= \lim_{n\to\infty} 0 = 0
                                                        \end{align*}
                                                        Thus the integral around any curve is 0, so there is a primitive for $g$, and that primitive has $g$ as a derivative so it is holomorphic, so we can take a second derivative and thus $g$ is holomorphic as well.

By increasing $d$, the maximum value of $g(z)$ is 1.

Now we can apply Cauchy's theorem and say that the given integral is 0 for any holomorphic function.

The integral of any closed curve is 0 since all but measure 0 points are 0, and yet $f$ is not holomorphic it is not even continuous.

Then we can find a primitive $F$ for $f$, and by the fundamental theorem of calculus, $\pfrac{F}{z} = f$. Thus $F$ is holomorphic and we can take a second derivative, which will be the derivative of $f$, so $f$ is also holomorphic.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Notice that the function $M(z) = \frac{w-z}{1-\conj{w}z}$ is a mobius transformation, and hence it is holomorphic and invertible. Thus $f\circ M^{-1}$ has inverse $M \circ g$ and since $M(w)=0$, both this function and it's inverse have a zero at $z=0$. Then by the schwarz lemma \ref{schwarz-lemma}, $\abs{(f\circ M^{-1})(z)} \leq \abs{z}$ and $\abs{(M\circ g)(z)} \leq \abs{z}$.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        As these two functions are inverses, we must in fact have equality: $\abs{(f\circ M^{-1})(z)} = \abs{z}$. Now using another form of the schwarz lemma \ref{schwarz-lemma-2}, we can conclude that $(f\circ M^{-1})(z) = e^{i\theta}z$, and therefore that
