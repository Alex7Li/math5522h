\maketitle

Last week, we saw the local version of Cauchy's theorem and we met the
\textbf{Cauchy integral formula}. This week we will continue these
discussions and unravel consequences of Cauchy's work.  Look in Stein
and Shakarchi's \textit{Complex Analysis} focusing on
\begin{itemize}
\item 2.3 Evaluation of some integrals
\item 2.4 Cauchy's integral formulas
\end{itemize}
and in Ahlfors' \textit{Complex Analysis} in
\begin{itemize}
\item 4.2 Cauchy's Integral Formula
\item 4.2.1 The Index of a Point with Respect to a Closed Curve
\item 4.2.2 The Integral Formula
\item 4.2.3 Higher Derivatives
\end{itemize}

We will review our discussion of \textbf{winding number}.  This
supports a deeper exploration of the topological concerns, culminating
in the \textbf{general form} of Cauchy's theorem based in the idea of
\textbf{homology}.  From Palka's \textit{An Introduction to Complex
  Function Theory}, read
\begin{itemize}
\item V.4.1 Branches of Logarithms of Functions
\item V.4.2 Logarithms of Rational Functions
\item V.4.3 Branches of Powers of Functions
\item V.5.1 Iterated Line Integrals
\item V.5.2 Cycles
\item V.5.3 Cauchy's Theorem and Integral Formula
\item V.6.1 Simply Connected Domains
\item V.6.2 Simple Connectivity, Primitives, and Logarithms
\item V.7.1 Homotopic Paths
\item V.7.2 Contractible Paths
\end{itemize}
or from Ahlfors' \textit{Complex Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
\item 4.4 The General Form of Cauchy's Theorem
\item 4.4.1 Chains and Cycles
\item 4.4.2 Simple Connectivity
\item 4.4.3 Homology
\item 4.4.4 The General Statement of Cauchy's Theorem
\item 4.4.5 Proof of Cauchy's Theorem
\end{itemize}
Our quiz from last week had you exploring
$\int_\gamma \frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz$ on a certain domain.  This week we
extend this to consider when we can find single-valued branches of
certain popular functions like logs and roots.  All this theory
continues to support our ability to do ``numericals'' so we'll have a
couple more integration problems.
