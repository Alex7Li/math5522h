We've been thinking about complex differentiable functions, so if we
have been considering differentiability, it is only appropriate that
we now consider \textbf{integrals}.  Our basic goal is to define the
integral of a 1-form $f\,dz$ over curves $\gamma$.  Sometimes our
integrands will involve $dx$ or $dy$ or $d\bar{z}$ or $|dz|$.  In
addition to these definitions, a significant goal will be working
through many classic examples.

For a quite brief overview, look to Stein and Shakarchi's
\textit{Complex Analysis} and focus on
\begin{itemize}
\item 1.3 Integration along curves
\end{itemize}
Or for a lenghtier discussion, consult Palka's \textit{An Introduction to Complex Function Theory} and read
\begin{itemize}
\item IV.1.1 Paths
\item IV.1.2 Smooth and Piecewise Smooth Paths
\item IV.1.3 Parametrizing Line Segments
\item IV.1.4 Reverse Paths, Path Sums
\item IV.1.5 Change of Parameter
\item IV.2.1 Complex Line Integrals
\item IV.2.2 Properties of Contour Integrals
\item IV.2.3 Primitives
\item IV.2.4 Some Notation
\item IV.3.1 Rectifiable Paths
\item IV.3.2 Integrals Along Rectifiable Paths
\end{itemize}
These topics are also covered in Ahlfors' \textit{Complex Analysis}
textbook in
\begin{itemize}
\item 4.1 Fundamental Theorems
\item 4.1.1 Line Integrals
\item 4.1.2 Rectifiable Arcs
\item 4.1.3 Line Integrals as Functions of Arcs
\end{itemize}
